Slack Ettiquite

# Size Matters - Pay attention to the channel size
* Slack can be thought of as a set of conference rooms, varying in size from a small Short-Term-Parking (STP) sized space to a large conference auditorium or even a football stadium in some cases. Keep in mind that your posts will be seen by everyone in the channel, and, once sent, may forever be archived even if you delete them, so be nice.

## READ PINNED ITEMS
* At the top of every slack channel, just below the channel name, is a pin icon. Click that before you say ANYTHING in the channel. Read the pinned items first. Often, there will be useful information and links therein that might even answer your question.

## Use of @here and @channel
* In a HUGE channel
If you're in a stadium-sized channel and you use *@here* or *@channel*, you're triggering notifications to 60,000 people. Now those 60,000 people all think they have a message directed specifically to them, or an important announcement that is not to be missed. They get grouchy because they were distracted from what they were doing, and it's a waste of time to get back into their previous context. It's kind of like walking into the public address booth and grabbing the microphone and broadcasting your message over the stadium loudspeakers - unless you've got a legitimate emergency (there's a moon-sized meteor headed for earth) or your role specifically requires you to communicate an announcement to everyone in the channel, please don't. It's a resource waste similar to that of mass reply-to-all emails. Further, channels of this size are often not monitored by anyone who can help you anyway, because the volume of messages typically makes it impossible to keep up. They're useful for reading general chatter and sentiment, not for specific questions.

* In a support channel, regardless of the size
If you're in a smaller channel that is dedicated to supporting a particular service, event, or technology and you need help or have questions, the analogy is slightly different, but the same rule applies. You wouldn't go into the DMV and yell, "HEY EVERYONE, I NEED A NEW DRIVER'S LICENSE! CAN SOMEONE TAKE A LOOK?!". That's what @here and @channel do. Support channels typically have someone monitoring the channel for questions like yours - Sometimes your message may get lost in the traffic, so a little polite prodding might be warranted, such as "Hey, y'all, did anyone happen to see my message from 3 hours ago? I'm blocked and could really use some help if someone's available." But be nice about it.

* Team Channels
If you're in a channel devoted to day-to-day work for a team you work on, then work with your team to decide whether or not using @here indiscrimately is appropriate. In many of these cases, it's fine, as the content of your @here message is indeed relevant by everyone in the channel.

## Joining a new channel

* If you're joining a new channel because a service or resource you need is unavailable, read up in the channel for the last half hour or so to see if others have already started a discussion on the issue. It may well be a known issue that is actively being worked - in these cases, there's no need to say, "I'm experiencing this problem too" unless your experience differs from anything already discussed.

* If the help you need seems specific to you, and you've established by reading recent posts that there's no ongoing incident, just ask for what you need. Just saying 'hello' and waiting for a response is a waste of your time and the person or group you're talking to. Instead, say, "Hello, I'm Joe from R&D, and I'm trying to figure out how to use the fizbuzz git server. I'm getting, `401 Unauthorized` but I'm pretty sure I'm authorized. Can someone take a look when you have a moment?"

* Don't use @here and @channel

* Read the pinned items.
