Slack Ettiquite

## Please don't just say hello

If you need something, say it. Just saying 'hello' and waiting for a response is a waste of your time and the person or group you're talking to.

## Use `@channel` / `@here` sparingly in support channels.

* Support channels tend to be monitored. Notifying everyone is rude. Instead just ask your question.

## When joining a support channel, read the channel topic and the last few minutes of text that are on the screen.

* When there's a known issue, you won't be the only one experiencing it. Would you jump into an arbitrary room of people and yell "Is <service> down?" No? Then don't do it on slack.

## Don't ask if you can ask questions

* Again, just ask your question.
